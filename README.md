<h1 align = "center">Hi there, I’m Dezerae. </h1>


I am a cell biologist :microbe: working to uncover the molecular drivers :test_tube: of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Motor Neuron Disease :brain:. My work has taken me to the intersection of wet-lab biology :microscope: and data science :computer:, and as a self-taught pythonista :snake: I am always learning  :mortar_board:. Head [here](https://dezeraecox.com/about-me/) to find out a little more about my science :woman_scientist:,  otherwise read on for more about my code creations :woman_technologist:. 


## Publication repositories

For a detailed list of my publications, you can find my full CV [here](https://dezeraecox.com/cv-publications/). If you're more interested in the code, below are some of the open-access repositories that accompany recent manuscripts I've been involved in.

## Community projects

Outside serious science stories, I love the challenge of bringing data exploration and visualisation to new contexts using my amateur coding skills.

<!-- <img src="images/investigators_banner.png" width="1000px">  -->
- *Investigating the Investigators* - Series examining the outcomes of a major source of annual Australian Fellowship funding: The NHMRC Investigator Grants. Check out the code for the [2019 edition](https://github.com/dezeraecox/Investigator-Grants-2019) of the analysis, or get your hands on the data via the [2020 edition](https://github.com/dezeraecox/Investigator-Grants-2020).

<!-- <img src="images/pears_banner.png" width="1000px">  -->
- *PEARS: student metrics analysis platform* - Streamlit app, created in consulation with secondary school teachers looking to visually evaulate student outcomes across a cohort. Check out the code [here](https://github.com/dezeraecox/student-metrics-analysis-platform) or head straight to the [PEARS app](https://pears-platform.herokuapp.com/) 

<!-- <img src="images/tsla_banner.png" width="1000px">  -->
- *TSLA: Time series labelling app* - Streamlit app providing a simple platform to manual classify time series datasets destined for machine learning applications. Check out the code [here](https://github.com/dezeraecox/time-series-labelling-app) or head straight to the [TSLA app](https://time-series-labelling-app.herokuapp.com/) 

## Template repositories

As the lines between biology and big data blur, researchers are having to find ever-evolving best practices for organising and curating their research output. Here are some templates I use to organise my day-to-day analysis:

- [Experiment template](https://github.com/dezeraecox-experiments/experiment) - basic architecture for computational analysis of data from individual wet-lab experiments
- [Analysis template](https://github.com/dezeraecox-experiments/analysis) - basic parent repository architecture for meta-analysis of mutliple experiments, for which individual experiment repositories added as sub-modules
- [Manuscript (publishing)](https://github.com/dezeraecox-manuscripts/manuscript_public) - example repository architecture for constructing a public-facing code repository to accompany a manuscript
- [Manuscript (writing)](https://github.com/dezeraecox-manuscripts/manuscript_writing) - example repository providing basic functionality to draft and compile scientific manuscripts in markdown using VSCode, pandoc and inkscape

## Ask me about... My toolbox!

As a scientist-turned-programmer, I am constantly looking for the best (and most efficient!) tools. I regularly post [toolbox talks]((https://dezeraecox.com/toolbox/)) describing the tools I use as an academic researcher. When it comes to coding, here is a snapshopt of some of my favourite tried-and-trusted tools:

- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) for all things organisation - notes, project management, resource archiving..
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for editing
- [MiniConda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for environment management
- [CellPose](https://cellpose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for image segmentation
- [Napari](https://github.com/napari/napari) for image visualisation
- [Cytoscape]() for network visualisation
